# Activity Recognition Model

## Abstract
This repository contains the implementation of an activity recognition model. The model is developed using keypoint extraction from video frames, and it is trained with both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN). The project aims to accurately classify a construction worker's human activities from video data.

## Usage
To train and evaluate the activity recognition model, follow these steps:

## Features
- **Keypoint Extraction**: Utilizes keypoint extraction techniques to preprocess video frames.
- **Model Architectures**: Implements both LSTM and 1D CNN for training on the extracted keypoints.
- **Activity Classification**: Capable of classifying construction workers' activities into working or not working from video data.
