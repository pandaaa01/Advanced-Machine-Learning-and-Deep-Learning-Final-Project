# Work Monitoring of Construction Workersâ€™ Productivity and Safety using Deep Learning

## Abstract
With the evolving technology of computer vision and deep learning, work and safety monitoring has always been a tedious task especially in the construction industry. This brings the paper to a solution of implementing 2 deep learning models that monitors construction worker's activity with the help of Human Activity Recognition using Skeletal Approach. In detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) , YOLOv8, RTMDet, and YOLOv9 will be tested to determine what model is suitable for this task. After evaluating the performance of the models, the best PPE Detection model is YOLOv9 with a remarkable performance of 93% in detecting different safety equipment. Human Activity Recognition was implemented in order to classify if a worker is working or not. The Skeletal Approach was done with two model architectures. The first one is with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which resulted in 99% accuracy. One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture yields to 95% accuracy.
